1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Echoes (Half-Life mod) to sven coop. After playing 
this awesome mod i started to make a port of it to be added to my server but shortly 
i stop working on it. Months later, after closing my servers i decided to resume the 
work and finish this, as a challenge. I aim to add as most of the content of the 
original mod as possible. You are free to report bugs or suggest changes if you want 
but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do this as a hobby and for the 
challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server owners.

2. Important Notes 
echoes10 may take a long while to load nut it works, it is not a bug. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
Some models and sounds were not included yet. I may add them in the future.
Some effects are missing or not fully implemented (env_shockwave, custom env_shooter)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
-low fps in some maps: i did plenty to optimize the map, even if there is some stuff
that can be improved a bit the main problem is wpoly rising to very high values, i 
cannot do anything about that.
-echoes09a: in battle otis vs. bullsquid the bullsquid always win. This is because
if otis wins he gets bugged and stays still, i could not solve it yet.
-echoes12: when the elevator is falling players may "explode", i am not sure how to
fix this.
-echoes19: the scientist does not open the door for bonus goods, i could not find
why the scientist is not detected by the trigger.
-echoes20: the scientist and barney dialogs does not work.
-echoes22: yes, i know about that.
