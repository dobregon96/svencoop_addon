[ Never - 09 Edition ]
[ RECOMMENDED FOR 3-6 PLAYERS ]

The operation was a joke. Our HEV task force was tricked. Fooled into travelling to Xen on a "top priority" mission, instead being deceived and thrown into captivity, sold away by the very man that sent us.  Why are we still alive?

This dimension has some sort of weird effect on the subconscious... seeing visions.. hearing voices?
