sc_buildingjumper is my first game map.
I know it is looks poor.
I made it for Sven Co-op V4.8 in,ehh...maybe in 2014?
And I remake it for Sven Co-op V5.0 in 2017.
Emm,maybe there's still some entity BUGs in this map.
If you discover any bug,and also you have time(of course you would like to do that),you can fix these bugs by yourself.
Why not fix these bug by myself?Because I have already written this is the FINAL version,I think I would better don't change it anymore.
If you are a host of a server,and you wanna add this map into your server,you can fix these possible bugs.
So I add the ENT file in this package.
