-----------------------------------------

You are a unfortunate crew of security guards caught in the midst of the Black Mesa disaster, you must now
fight your way out of the facility to survive. Almost no one is on your side, so value the allies you find.

Just a few moments ago, a message was transmitted over the radio, indicating that a airborne rescue from the surface
is possible, however they will not wait forever, so you will need to move quickly.

There are also rumors that the old facilities hold a way out, but so far these are only rumors.

Other notes; 

Alot in this map is controlled by random triggers, so what happens one time might not happen the other.
