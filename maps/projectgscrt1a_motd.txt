============PROJECT: GUILTY - Mission 1=================== 

Mission Info: 

A ancient village in South America has been taken over by a Columbian drug lord and 

his army, who wishes to use the treasures in the village to fund his anti-US activities 

While your Primary Mission has been a success so far, we have been unable to 

stop the sale of a number of the Totems, the Drug Lord recieved a large reward for 

his efforts and has purchased a classified super-weapon. We are unsure of its 

abilities, but it needs to be destroyed. Your mission is to damage the weapon beyond 

repair and destroy all remaining totems, before we have a second weapon to worry about.

They may have more than one of these advanced weapons in stock.


Primary objective : Find and destroy the advanced weapon 

Secondary objective: Destroy all ruins that are left in the village
