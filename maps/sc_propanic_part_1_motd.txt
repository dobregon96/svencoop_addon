Map: SC_PROPANIC_PART 1

Created by Christopher "Trempler" Lembrecht
=============================================================

Greetings @Everyone,
after a long time, I finally found time to release my propanic map.
The map was in development for way too long and it took even longer because I kept reworking the map and parts of it.

You are a member of squad that is trying to invade the propanic's base in order to rescue a prisoneer and destroy their secret project. 

The map features:
			- 3 difficulties
			- 4 custom weapons
			- a lot of custom models, sprites, and sounds
			- an insane boss fight
			- secrets

The map is huge and was split into 2 maps so the engine is able to run it.
The map needs at least 2 players, but I would recommend 4-6 for the best experience.

Good luck and I would love to get some comments and feedback. 

I hope you like it,

Trempler
