Bunch of thanks for him, that he expanded the map with his great parts, and made the
map better and longer.

Also thanks to Beton that he made the "raw materials" for the elevator.

Map built for a MAXIMUM of 4 players. Much more players might make the map unplayable!
2 players are required to start the map!

Fight throught your way in a sort of storage facility until the end.
Collect items to make your way forward. 
If you died wait for someone to REVIVE you, there is only one checkpoint.
Work as a TEAM cover eachother's butt, and always heal your teammates.
At certain points of the map you can find small armories with all of the used weapons (except UZI).
These are for to let you get back the weapon what you've lost because of dying.
