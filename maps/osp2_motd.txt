Mission Xtreme - Map 2

Your Team has made it to home base but it’s been completely over-taken, the  enemy is everywhere! There are three main areas to this installation. You will  start in area #1 and must gain access to areas #2 and #3 in order to complete  your Team’s second mission objectives. First find a way into the main offices  and unlock the secured door, (HINT: you will need to look outside) then you  will have to find and shut down the power generator in order to take the  security system off-line to access area #2.  Make you way to the dangerous  bowels of the underground installation, look out for alien experiments. Find a  guard who will open a security door, then look for a key that will give access  to area #3. Finally in area #3, it will be a tough battle. Infiltrate the main  building, take down the osprey, find a switch to open the main security door,  destroy the chopper, fight the bots, and destroy the defense system. Remember,  you must complete all tasks in order to continue to the next area and start  the next mission objective.
