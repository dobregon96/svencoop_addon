Broken Path
Made By The-Real-Game
---------------------

 Hello once again, this map is a bit of an unexpected release from me. Originally this was destined to
be level one of my 3 part Zero series. However after alot of testing it was decided it didn't really fit in. So for a month or two this map was just left to sit in my map folder uncompleted. That was until a week or so ago, when I decided to remake the map. It's quite a bit different from the screenshots some of you may have seen. The old ending of a library was scraped and replaced by what I think is a much better section. 

So in conclusion just give this map a try and see if you like it or not, this is only the first beta, so feel free to email me giving me suggestions on what to change or post feedback in the thread at the svencoop forums : www.svencoop.com/forums/
