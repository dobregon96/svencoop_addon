Mission:
1-Infultrate the secret base.
2-Kill everyone in the facility.
3-Find entrance to lower level labs.
4-Rescue shocktroopers.



Mission brief:
You will be met with tough resistance. The base is heavily guarded by 
Apache helicopters. Xen is sending in troops to save the shocktroopers
with the intent of creating an ally against the army of zombie grunts, but to 
no avail. Instead of creating an ally they find themselves fighting more 
than just the grunts. Once you have cleared this section of the facility 
procede on to the lower levels where the shocktroopers
are being held. The shocktroopers are in poor health therefore they 
won't be much help. Once released they will aid you against the enemy 
the best they can.
