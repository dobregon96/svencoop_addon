       Black-Facility - Final Version
             A map for Sven Coop

       Made by: AGAMEMNON (Alex_Scheinert@web.de)
       Suitable for 2-5 players

MAP DESCRIPTION

A walkthough map with high-detail, violent battles and some adverure-like puzzles.
Setting is very realistic.
Map is the biggest HL can deal with.
Example: I got a MAX_MAP_ENTITIES error, so this Map can't be any larger!

CHANGES that are in the Final Version:

- Custom Sound with Resident Evil Theme (For the Lab)
- Fixed "Jump over the Tank" error
- Some little changes not worth to be written...

MISSION OBJECIVE:

Because of an unknown reason you are stuck in a Research-Komplex witch is located somewhere in America.
You have no idea how you came there and you don't want to stay there for long, but maybe forever.
Since you have Monsters, Guns and your Brain, simply connect them and you know, what you have to do.
(NO don't shoot yourself in the head!!!)
With other words:
Shoot those bastards and get out of there!
