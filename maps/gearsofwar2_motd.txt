Mission Info: 

Wellcome to the battle that has been coined as second Stalingrad.Here a constant skrimishes take place over a large portion of buildings.Areas change hands up to dozens of times and often a battle occurs over as small area as corner of a bathroom or edge of a small factory.The situation is shitty , but it aint hopeless.Defeat the damn osprey and the enemy should widthraw from the area.Dont forget that there are some hideouts full of supplies and shit , use them for your advantage - but most importantly clear them out before you can use them.Good luck! Dont forget that enemies have some hidden snipers in the area as well. 

Primary Goal : Kill the osprey. 

Secondary Goal : Kick some as! 
                  
Tips:

*Dont fuck up! 
*Use starchel charges and trip mines , if you find them. 
*There are snipers all over the place , they often change location. 
*there are some secrets too , dont miss them.
*your health constantly regenerates , but dont rely on that too much.Use batteries to recharge your armor as well.
