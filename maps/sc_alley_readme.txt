Title: Sc_alley
	A map for SvenCoop (http://come.to/half-life)

Author: Nathan Pearson(aka,Vince) (fr_vincent22@hotmail.com)

Type of Map: Coop 

Recommended players: 2-4

Playing Tips:   -watch out for the little things they can be of some useage

		-the water is clear but the grunts have a hard time seeing through it

		-Don't take anything for granted. Just because you loaded
                the map up and played for a minute doesn't mean you can
                predict everything that will happen.
