*Installation*

Extract the Zip file to your hardisk. You should then have a directory called 101Grunt. Copy the .BSP files to you HALFLIFE/VALVE/MAPS directory and copy the.NOD and .NRP files to HALFLIFE/VALVE/MAPS/GRAPHS directory. Place the rain.spr file in your HALFLIFE/VALVE/SPRITES directory. In your Halflife shortcut makesure you "-console". Start Halflife, from the console type map 101GRNT1 (NAME IN CAPITALS). you can also set the skill level by typing skill n (n=1,2 or 3)

*Notes*
This is my first level for Halflife. The reason its called 101 Grunts is because their are 101 grunt enemies in the level. There is also 4 Assassins and some gun turrets. I have made this level because I think fighting the grunts was the best aspect of the gameplay in halflife. This level is by no means perfect. I haven't got the AI as good as the original game but they will take cover, use doors and stairs. The architecture in the level is basic but adequate. I would appreciate some feedback on any aspects of the level.

*Hints* (Only read if your stuck)

You shouldn't really get stuck as the level is fairly linear but on the second map where the two big main doors are and there is a T-junction you first have to go left because there is a door on the right. That door is opened in the room where there are two switches next to each other. The first switch shows a cut scene of the control room door opening. The second switch opens the door by the main doors which is enroute to the control room.

The only other problem you may find is when you encounter the assassins. It first appears that you are trapped and that you can't get out even if you have killed the assassins. The answer is that on the far wall by the opposite door are two small boxes. These are hiding a vent that will give you access to the control room.
