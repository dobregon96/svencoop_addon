Welcome to the Insurgency.

Consider this some sort of sandbox/training map.

Some things you should know about the weapons:
·The player must manually input the reloads every time a weapon runs out of ammo;
·Primary and secondary ammo can be shared with their respective commands (dropammo, dropsecammo);
·It's possible to look down the sights in almost all weapons, with secondary attack (Right click by default)
	-Reduces player movement speed, but increases accuracy;
·Some weapons support firemodes that can be switched by pressing Use and Reload (E+R by default) at the same time;
·Almost every weapon can be used underwater
	-Firearms have reduced accuracy, rate of fire and damage; flamethrower will not work
	-Projectiles have reduced speed and damage radius;
·Tertiary attack (mouse3, mouse wheel button) has different behaviors on some weapons
	-Deploy grenade launcher
	-Deploy bipod
	-Melee attack (only on weapons with bayonets);
·The hand grenades have 3 attacks
	-Primary attack cooks the grenade, it's timed and it can explode on the player's hand
	-Secondary attack throws the grenade without cooking it
	-Tertiary attack lobs the grenade, shortens the thrown distance, again without cooking it.
