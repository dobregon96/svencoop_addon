THE TOMB OF DEATH - PART 2
**************************


Having ventured deep into the tomb, you have discovered an array of deadly traps, some very strange artifacts and mysterious creatures which you couldn't identify. You are now trapped in the tomb. Having discovered a group of dead soldiers you are concerned on what the heck is in this place. But fortunately their equipment and weapons have been left behind so it's unlikely that their killers were human. You set up a perimeter with their sentry turrets.

Although armed troops packing that much firepower just for a mouldy tomb seems very unusual...
