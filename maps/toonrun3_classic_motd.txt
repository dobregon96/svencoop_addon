MISSION OBJECIVE

Now that you are deeply inside the base of the Mother Spleen[tm],
there is no turning back. You'll have to find the beast, but
before you can fight against her you'll have to find
the Evil-Machine and destroy it.

Good Luck and remember...
you are our last hope
*cough*
I wish I'd get a dollar for every
time I have to say that.
