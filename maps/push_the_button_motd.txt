A fun and annoying map.

Minimum of 2 players are required!


Push the correct buttons to open the EXIT door.

Each row of buttons have one correct button on both sides. 
So that is a totall of 4 correct buttons. Be aware, each time
when the map loaded the four correct buttons (one in each row) will be
chosen randomly. So each time different buttons open the exit door.
One more thing, wrong buttons explode the shit out of you.

Wait for others before start the map, otherwise they won't able to hear the
music, which is an essential part of the map.
