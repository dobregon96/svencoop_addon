ARENA FIGHTS - Sven-coop

Objective: Find you way through the 3 Arenas and activate the
3 BIG buttons to get out.

Tips:

» The 1st Arena is the old storage, you will find there some soldiers
   and they will fight with you.

» The 2nd Arena is the teleport test lab. There are freindly soldiers too,
    but they stay behind the laser barricade and aren't a big help. After
    a while the lasers will turn off and you can get to the button.

» The 3rd Arena is the water recycling station. To get to the button, you 
    have to deactivate the water pump system. If you did that you can 
    reach the button.

» You need 2 players to proceed.
