Map: quad
By: Streamfox & Maiten
Version: Final
---------------------

This map is designed for exactly 2 players. 
More kinda ruin the concpet of the map.
If more players, then you should let 2 players
do the puzzles at once.
================================================
quad is a simple jump and skill map. 
Work as a team to pass throught various puzzles until the end. 

Red and yellow guildlines on grounds and walls
will help you which switch trigger what.

The carts or cars, whatever, work on this way:
The cars control the other one. I think you'll figure this out.

Pressure platforms work on this way:
Blue controls orange.
