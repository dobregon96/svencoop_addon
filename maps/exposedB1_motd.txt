Gordon received an urgent message from Sven Viking 
this morning. The message stated that a contact has 
disclosed information about a secret research complex. 
The informant also told Sven that scientist in this 
facility are experimenting with data and specimens 
collected from the Black Mesa incident. 

Fearing the worst, Gordon arranges to meet with Sven 
and his Team. Soon after landing near the drop site, 
Sniper finds a fresh air intake vent that leads inside.
