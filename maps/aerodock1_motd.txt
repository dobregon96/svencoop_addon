Note: 
-Gravity is controlled inside the facillity.

-The enemy has a secondary base set up on a nearby planet.

-You may encounter xen forces on your mission.

-Bring the hostage back to the insertion point where we will have a space craft waiting for your pick up.

-If you reach a ledge in the map which you've tried to boost up but you're being blocked, it meamns you're not meant to go there yet. I'm sorry but i didn't want people shortcutting the map.
