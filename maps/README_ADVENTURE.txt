Please unzip all the files to the !-Half-Life directory-!. The sub-folders will be created automatically. If you have problems please mail to "ackymail@t-online.de".
If you think that the map is too hard or to easy just change the number behind "skill" in the configuration file ("adventure_x.cfg" in the svencoop\maps\ folder) to 1 or 3.

*you need this only when you have problems*
all .wad to ...\svencoop\
all .cfg, .txt and .bsp to \svencoop\maps\

Have fun!
Acky
