The score is based on players deaths and time token to complete each puzzle.
Each deaths will subtract 100 points
The tops scores will be saved,if you reach the top 1 your nick will be saved in the 
scoreboard stadistics (use key on scoreboard to see),it can saved up to 4 players nick
i have put these limit because the map supposedly is done for 2 players
the statistics will be reload after you complete 2 puzzles

Try playing without scxpm,some versions of scxpm can ruin some things in the map

HAVE FUN!
