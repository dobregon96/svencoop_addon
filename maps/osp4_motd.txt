MAP Osp4 - MISSION OBJECTIVE:

Congratulations, you have completed your mission.
Your team has reclaimed Home Base and overtaken the enemy.

The enemy’s alien experiments have been destroyed.
No advance technology has been compromised.

You've saved our way of life,
And future generations from evil enemy control.
Job well done!

But it's not over, just yet...

Your Team must make your way into Mission Headquarters.
Fight your way past the left-over enemy experiments,
go inside to find the entrance into the dark underground Labyrinth.

But beware...

There are reports of an unseen alien bio-experiment hiding in the shadows!
Find your way up and out.
(Later There is a celebration for your success, it's time for some well deserved R & R)
