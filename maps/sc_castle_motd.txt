CASTLE DEFENCE


Your team are charged with protecting a nuclear warhead we have aquired and are storing in a heavily fortified castle that is also part of our intelligence network. Unfortunately a foreign army hell bent on stealing the bomb has discovered your location and are preparing an all-out assault. If they can't take the weapon they will try to destroy it, not only destroying the castle and dealing a major blow against our operations, but it also means you won't get paid. Oh, and you'll be vaporised by the nuclear blast.

Failure is not an option!
