===============================================
Mission brief:
A hostile company has hired some mercenaries to
capture our top building contracters. This 
company plans to sell our building designs to 
"interested" 3rd parties. This would greatly 
comprimize our ability to protect our bases.
Only the lead contractor need make it to the 
guard shack his assistant doesn't have the 
information the company is seeking. The problem 
is we don't have a discription of the lead 
contractor so you will need to bring them both.

If they can't get him alive they will kill him
instead to slow down our construction progress.
