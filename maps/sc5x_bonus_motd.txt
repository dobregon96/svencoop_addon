HIDE AND SEEK

Hiders [Blue]:
Stay hidden for as long as you can. Don't get caught.

Seeker [Red]:
Find the hiders. Catch them. (By "tagging" them with your knife.)

The Captured Room:
When a hider is found and caught, they go to the Captured Room.
Once captured you cannot re-join the round unless another hider sets you free with the "Security Override" button.

Each round lasts 5 minutes before it resets.

TO SWITCH BETWEEN HIDER/SEEKER

* To become a hider say ".hider" in the text chat.
* To become a seeker say ".seeker" in the text chat.
* By default you will be a hider when joining the game.
* Seekers will be reset to hiders at the end of every round. Please give others a fair chance to play as a seeker.
* Use console command "hns" to see the game rules/settings.

There are two main areas beyond the subway, which are the Docks and the City. Access to these areas alternates each round.
Faint red lasers are a visual indication of the map boundary. (They don't hurt.) You can't jump over them though so don't bother trying.

General hiding tips:

Keep moving.

* Moving from one spot to another as often as possible decreases your chances of getting caught !
* Try not to all stay bunched up for easy pickings.
* Try not to get chased by a seeker directly. They can run faster than you, and will likely catch you. Be sneaky instead.

Use your imagination.

* A lot of good hiding places can be found by good observation and some clever jumping.
* You aren't limited to the obvious places. (E.g. many vent covers don't need to be broken to get into.)

You can "hang" from the ledges of exposed vents.

* This allows you to "shimmy" to otherwise inaccessible places.

Shadows are your friend.

* Several lights around the city can be turned off and on.
* There are also many dark areas around the city.

Communicate carefully.

* Text chat will ONLY be kept secret among your team if you use the team say function. Bind something to `messagemode2` for that.
* Voice chat will NEVER be kept secret among your team. This can reveal your position.
* Using "medic" and "take cover" can stupidly reveal your position, but can be used as a taunt if you dare.
