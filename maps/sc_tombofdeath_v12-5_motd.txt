THE TOMB OF DEATH - PART 5
**************************


You've stumbled upon another one of the big monsters nests. But this time, big mamma wasn't alone. The much warmer temperature due to the lava must have incubated the eggs and allowed the deadly things to hatch. The sight of a small group of soldiers could, just could, mean that there are survivors of this nightmare.

You go on. A cold draft was felt when you entered the monster's chamber, suggesting that there is a ventilation system in this complex. Perhaps you could use that to escape?
