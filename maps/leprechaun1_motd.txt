      Leprechaun Trilogy

         *By Penguin*

You are a member of the elite
'Svencoop' fighting team, responsable
for the Assault on Black Mesa and 
defeat of the Gargantuan Overlord.

While on the way back to home base,
you recieved a call on the SAT phone
and given coordinates to a new location
to be briefed on a new mission.

After countless hours of flying, the 
chopper touched down on a helipad in
an ancient castle, bustling with military
soldiers...







Additional Notes:
Leprechaun King model idea was axed...it will be a scientist forever.

This is the version released for the SC Top 50 Map Pack
