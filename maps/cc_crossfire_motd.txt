Time for some wacky fun on the old classic Valve maps! Can you fight through to the bonus point rounds to score some epic points? Who will come out on top?! Who stole my watch? What happened to the sky? What year is this?!

Follow the instructions on-screen on how to complete each round! Be sure to use the 'move to position' command during the escort round!
