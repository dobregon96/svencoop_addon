Arctic base by James Ham AKA Hunter Alpha

Two weeks ago we lost contact with our 
arctic base and since then we have sent
a military squad to investigate but we 
have now lost contact with the squad. You
must find out what happened and secure 
the base. A team of scientists (and escorts)
will arrive an hour after you do. 

NOTES:

-We will keep in contact with you
and advise you accordingly
