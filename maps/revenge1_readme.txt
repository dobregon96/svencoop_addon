=========================================================

Note: This is a new version of the episode originally released 2/27/99
It contains bug fixes to software rendering problems and level change
difficulties encountered in the original release. Software video mode
users will encounter a few washed out textures in heavily detailed areas.
I highly recommend using a 3dfx card for optimal performance.

* Credits *

Special thanks to everyone at Valve for creating Half Life
Huge thanks to Autolycus at gamedesign.net for the tutorials, and to Lt.Dan
at planetquake for beta testing this creation.

* Prefabs *

I used a few of the finer prefabs I found on the net and a few of
my own. Many thanks to those whose fabs I used !
  Revolver@gpm98.freeserve.co.uk   (pc prefab) -altered by me to
  toggle the monitor screen.
  xkineticx@thegrid.net  (tank and hummvw prefabs)

* Story *

Our hero has become very bitter toward the government for sending in the
stormtroopers to kill everything at Black Mesa, including himself. He finds
his way to another installation where the government continues experimenting 
with the world of Xen. With the taste of blood still fresh in his mouth, he
sets out to get some more. His HEV suit, torn and battered, is of no use
and he will have to penetrate the lab complex to get a new one. If he can
blast his way through the gauntlet of enemies, an F-16 sits poised for his escape. 
The game ends at this point.

* Hints *


There are two hidden areas somewhere among the levels if you can find them.
Both present a challenge when you get there and a small reward. 
Look for the crowbar early in the game (water). End of hints....
Use the " [ and ] " keys to select previous/next weapon (check your key bind
settings in the "controls" configuration) and hit your trigger to switch to the
new selection. Don't worry, you will get a HEV suit to make things easier, but
you have to make it through the first map to get it. Don't forget that "using"
scientists is a good thing if you're very low on health, but you must have the
suit on first. Make sure you know how to "long jump" (without the jump module)

Ok....this is my first attempt at editing Half Life, and has proved to be
quite a challenge. I hope to have something a little more creative in the
next episode. In the mean time I hope you enjoy this. Let me know !  
Please feel free to send opinions about this to me. I will answer all mail
from people who wish to contact me, with the exception of level editing
questions.(read the tutorials at gamedesign.net!)

=======================================================

* Installation *

Extract the bsp files to your Half-Life\valve\maps folder. Run the graphs.exe 
to install the .nod files. The game will generate the .nod files anyway, but I 
included them to prevent that little rebuilding pause at the start of each map.
Check the file path of the .exe to make sure it matches yours and edit if needed.
Make a new folder in your Half-Life directory named Revenge. Extract the revenge.bat
and text files to that folder. Just double click the .bat file to run the game.
The skill is set at 2, but you can edit it if you want more\less of a challenge.
Or....start Half-Life with the -console command and type map revenge1 to start the game.
Using the .bat file will prevent the message text you occasionally see on the screen
when using the -dev-console method. *Note: Movement cheats will screw things up.
