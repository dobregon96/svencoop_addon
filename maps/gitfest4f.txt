This was my attempt to push the boundries of WorldCraft 3.3 and the Half-Life engine to their limits...
Looks good on my GeForce3 at 1280x960 resolution,
but the custom textures look blurry on my 16mb Vanta at 1024x768 so I guess it's system dependent...

There are more trigger_randoms in this map than I can count so each time you play it should be different

The following are the credits for the custom sky and the textures 
I converted to HL.wad format from jpgs I found on the internet:-
