Incoming message from <"Commander Woodlord">:

"The aliens already took over most of Europe and USA. They are not willing to negotiate. Their forces are too overwhelming so we need to get the data from research facility in sector 2-11. This data will give our superiors access to most of the nuclear missiles in the world. A bunch of nukes will get rid of those insects."

NEW DATA ADDED>>>
