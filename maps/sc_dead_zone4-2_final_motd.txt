Mission:
1-You will have to find the junction box and destroy it to open main gate.
2-Someone will have to summon the enemy Apache with the distress button.
     (The Apache must be summoned and destroyed in order to advance.)
3-Find a way to the lower level.
4-You will need to find security cards to open locked doors.
5-Again, kill everyone in facility.
6-In this episode you will need to find the mastermind behind the cloning 
machine and destroy him. Our intelligence sources tell us he has a small 
bunker-like room he may retreat to.

Mission brief:
It seems the cloning machine has advanced. They are now transforming captured
Xen creatures and our security personnel into troops. The proccess isn't working 
perfectly however and is producing zombie-like-grunts. There is also a report that
some of Black Mesa's security force is still alive and imprizoned. Try to rescue these 
guards they may be able to help, if they aren't too far gone. The scientists 
will try to kill anyone captured if the facility falls under attack, so be cautious. 
There have also been reports that the mastermind scientist turned his machine on 
himself, with equally disgusting results. There are many "failed transformations" 
held in cages. These creatures are very powerful and extremely dangerous so watch
yourselves. Good luck!
