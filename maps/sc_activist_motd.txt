Background

A nearby corporate laboratory has been participating in humane animal experiments for the betterment of mankind.  Being one of the great unwashed hippy generation, you and your tree hugging comrades have stormed level 1 security and cleared the lobby due to the ridiculous illegality of wooping hippy ass for no good reason.

Now armed with automatic weaponry gleaned from the armoury within and with S.W.A.T. sirens nearing, you take it upon yourselves to "liberate" the animals held in labs accessed from the upper floors.  No doubt you'll fuck some shit up on the way and release a plague or something, but hey, aren't those animals cute?

Primary goal

Attempt to free the cute little animals and waste years of research efforts.  

Secondary goal

Try not to unleash a deadly mutating bacterium in the process.
