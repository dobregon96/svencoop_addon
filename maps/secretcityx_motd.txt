New textures by slidje and me
Thanks to Slidje and Vorinc for helping with the map
Thanks to SV Boy for getting me back into making these secretcity changes and other stuff
Special thanks to garompa for making those weird map ripents. that wasnt my personal vision of a united secretcity storyline but I thought it was pretty inspiring and entertaining

Map Information: You appear in a building in an oddly angular city. What badly executed secrets can you discover here?

Tip: go down the stairs

Most of the changes made to this map were actually some of the last changes I made to secretcity5 as it failed to work anymore due to previous engine limits. After a many-year hiatus from Sven I came back to find the capabilities for mapping were expanded, so decided to try to release a last version of the map with some of the yet unseen stuff in it. I might work on a new secretcity at some point, or maybe even finish 6, but this one was my favorite so I was glad I could add some extra stuff to it.
