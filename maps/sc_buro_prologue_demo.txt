GENAserv and GENAbank finance a hydro-electric power plant in Kenya.
The Gouvernement was very proud to announce the opening of the high-end power station,
but GENAServ kept all gouvernemental supervisiors out of the power plant area.
After a bounty of two million USD the Gouvernement stopped to act against GENA.


The LIC incident 

After the isolation of the area GENA started to build up
a silo for biological material. During the first run of the complex, a tragical misstake,
after a wrong adjustment of a valve, happened and contaminated the whole area 
around the power plant.

After one year of silent development, a GENAbank in New York reported an attack and 
the taking of hostages during a night-shift at 4:20 am. Through the great influence
on the Gouvernement, GENA was able to send a loyal task force, to find answers on the
open questions.
