Changelog from entry contest to final(v1):

Redesigned outer area bunker 3
Completely remade bunker 2
Redesigned outer area bunker 1
Removed the spawn area, made a new one
Changed lighting scheme, which is now more appealing (no longer white lights)
Changed how players enter the bunkers (is now elevators for every bunker)
Changed how enemies can encounter the super computer (if psu's are broken, then doors are opened, which allows enemies to instantly see super computer)
Added more visual aid for beginning the map
Changed some monster types (not only alien grunts anymore)
Added new mechanic at bunker 1
Added zombies at bunker 1
Added visual aid for doors you cannot enter
Closed off path to bunker 1 at start, so players only have to defend bunker 2 and 3 at start
Added some more custom textures
Added some detail textures
Added a shotgun and some ammo here and there
Removed map 1, which was an introductionairy map, the map now only consists of one .bsp
Fixed text messages, they no longer appear in upper left corner, instead they appear in top center, also they are all consistent now. There's 2 types of messages: radio transmissions and messages which indicate map progress.
Added custom content (sprites, textures, sounds, detail textures)
Improved compile time by removing a big part of the underground rocks and replacing it with bunker like architecture
Changed timing of certain events (like computer entering a bunker)
Tried to optimize player walkable space, meaning that clip brushes have been added in order to either prevent players from getting somewhere or simply to improve compile time.
Used other settings in the compile which I will not list, since it's too unimportant to mention
Mission objectives and story line has been updated and other text files too (meaning the _motd.txt and the .txt itself, also the .res file)

Fixed more bugs which are too little to mention
